         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18509:16"/>Countie of <hi>Salop,</hi> and Dioceſſe of <hi>Hereford;</hi> a man, who by a long courſe of induſtrious painfulneſſe in the execution of his vocation, and frugality of diſpoſition in the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his family, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his affaires; had acquired unto himſelfe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent eſtate of livelihood, for his owne ſupport, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of his children: ſo that he paſſed in the reputation of all his neighbourhood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of rich men; living in peaceable manner in the courſe of his life, and good eſtimation among men of his ranke. This EDWARD, as he told me himſelfe, had two ſons, and five daughters. His two ſons, <hi>Enoch</hi> aged 34. and <hi>Iohn</hi> aged 31. he detained in his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18509:16"/>owne family with himſelfe, and educated them in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Husbandry, to execute his affaires, and to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport unto him in his elder yeares. <hi>Iohn</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother, was of perſontall, ſtrong, and proper; of quality affable and ſweet natur'd, of countenance, comely; moſt dutifully obedient to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, carefull of their welfare and thriving, and never known in one and thirty years, to have given any froward, ſtubborne, or undutifull reply in words to his father or mother: though his father was of condition au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere, and held a ſevere hand of government and command over him. <hi>Enoch</hi> was a fellow of a middle ſtature, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion ſwarthy, under the

But it is the practice of the world, when a man is in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to load him with falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, wherof ſince I came into this Priſon, I have had much experience by manifold ſlanders of whoredome and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices invented againſt me.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond Argument is this. <hi>Enoch</hi> a yeare before the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18509:59"/>death of his mother, is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to aske her this queſtion upon a Sunday, after they were returned from <hi>Clunne</hi> Church Mother, did not you heare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> heard the Miniſters voice ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to thee, and to me, and to all the Congregation: other voice I heard not, nor thy ſelfe neither. He is reported to aske her againe, Did you not heare a voice call unto me by name, and ſay, <hi>Enoch</hi> prepare? She<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is ſaid to anſwer him, Hold thy peace thou foole, I heard no ſuch voice, nor thou nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is alleaged againſt you, now anſwer for your ſelfe in truth and uprightneſſe. For
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18509:59"/>weakneſſe of braine, is no cauſe of ſhame or reproch to your perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Enoch.</hi> They talke much of the <hi>Divell</hi> and my ſelfe; but if they invent and deviſe ſuch lyes againſt mee in matters whereof I am no way guiltie, let the authours and contrivers thereof, take heed leſt that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit hold not as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and take as ſtrong poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their ſoules, as hee hath done in mine, according to their opinion and conceit. For certainly this report, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed, touching my queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with my mother, is ſuch a cunning lye, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ayme, or ſearch the depth of it. For by theſe words, <hi>Enoch prepare,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their meaning to be, as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18509:60"/>though <hi>Satan</hi> had caſt ſome thoughts into my heart touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the killing of my mother and brother, a whole yeare before I committed thoſe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable facts: But I have told you Sir, and doe further aſſure you of the truth therein, that my reſolution to ſlay my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was not fully ten dayes old before I brought it into execution. And if my mother were now living, who is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally periſhed by my enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged heart and accurſed hand, ſhe could and would cleare my reports, and denial of any ſuch queſtions moved unto her. I aſſure you therefore on my faith and truth, I never uſed any ſuch words unto her, nor never received any ſuch idle thought into my owne heart,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18509:60"/>as to imagine a voice to call to mee by name in the open Church, in the time of Divine Service, as people call it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third Argument. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> is certainly tainted in his braine with ſome weakneſſe, cauſed by the raigning power of melancholy, apt to diſpoſe and incline any man to frenzie and diſtemper: or elſe by ſome other noxious and malignant humour producing the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: And this is moſt certaine and beyond exception: for he hath oftentimes aſſayed by purging and phleboromie, to mitigate and correct the ſtrength of theſe humors, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing maladie and diſtemper in his minde. This objection I received from a very learned Doctor in Divinity, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18509:61"/>of the faculty and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſicke, of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for his Science there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And this hee told me was the common received opinion among Gentlemen of worth who neither wanted under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to judge of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor were raſhly credulous in beleeving flying rumours. Now know you <hi>Enoch</hi> this objection preſſeth hard upon you, let mee therefore have your juſt and true anſwere hereunto: For diſtempers ariſing from the ill conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodies, are no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to our perſons, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of pity and commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Enoch.</hi> Sir, I will fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your deſire, and give you the truth herein: I was in <hi>May</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:18509:61"/>two yeares paſt, let bloud and purged for a ſwelling in one of my feete, the remoteſt part from my head; and was at that time, neither affected with lightneſſe in my braine, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſickneſſe in my heart: That ſwelling in my foot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me at that time from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Newport,</hi> I being then a Traine-ſouldier of the Band of Captain <hi>Scriven</hi> an Eſquire of worth and learning wel known over all our County, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there to appeare to ſhew my Armour, and to traine with my fellowes of the ſame band. And at that time my brother <hi>Iohn</hi> ſupplied my roome by ſubſtitution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt from me unto him. At this anſwer of his, two of his ſiſters were in place in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18509:62"/>houſe, together with their husbands, and they all with unanimous conſent affirmed, and confirmed, that <hi>Enoch</hi> had never been accuſtomed to phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, but that hee was all his life-time of ſound conſtitution, ſtrong, active, nothing crazie, or ſubject to diſtemper in his braine, by any fits of rage and frenzie. And in confirmation hereof, the fore-named Maſter <hi>Scriven,</hi> a prudent, judicious, and learned Gentleman, came to the place of my dwelling, and deſired mee, that for as much as <hi>Enoch</hi> his ſouldier, late of his Train band, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged unto him in the Priſon-houſe, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived both comfort and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from me. I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ve and paines with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18509:62"/>him: I promiſed the wordly Gentleman to gratifie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and to take all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to ſee him. And I asked of him, Sir, did you ever heare of any diſtemper by lunacie or franticke moods in <hi>Enoch</hi> your ſouldier? He anſwered me, I have never heard of any thing in him, but very religious and well, before this vaſt triall for his ſinnes befell him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth Argument, is this. <hi>Enoch</hi> was ſeene to ſtand naked in a river up to his breſt, lading water up in his hands, and caſting it on his head and face, and continued a good while in this river. At that time a Gentleman of that neighbour hood, one Maſter <hi>Powel,</hi> is ſaid to ride by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſeeing <hi>Enoch</hi> naked
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18509:63"/>therein, caſting water on his face, call'd to him, <hi>Enoch,</hi> what doeſt thou there? <hi>Enoch</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to anſwer this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to his queſtion, I am waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away my ſins. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Powel</hi> is ſaid to reply, That's not water to waſh away ſins, counſelled him to go forth of the river, to put on his cloaths, and repaire home. This report goes ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant over all this County and country, that he who ſhall on <hi>Enochs</hi> behalfe deny credence thereunto, is taken for an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perſon, paſt honeſty, or conſcience: for ſo generally had this lying rumour ſpread it ſelfe, and prevailed for truth, that perſons of eminent ranke, and very wiſe withall, were wonderfully taken therewith. And the concluſion was, <hi>Enoch</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:18509:63"/>is a fellow of frequent diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſurely the inſtigation to thoſe murders was the rage of his affections cauſed by the weaknes &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of his brain, and not any reference to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. Now <hi>Enoch</hi> let me have your anſwer to this in ſincerity, without any diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or mincing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for as I told you before, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in ſoule or in body, do ſerve to move compaſſion in good men towards perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, but are no diſgrace at all to their perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Enoch.</hi> This argument is vaſt in ſhew, but thin &amp; light in the ſubſtance thereof, and therfore is ſoone anſwered. I am deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Sir, to give you the truth herein cleare, free, and full, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from all guile or diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18509:64"/>I referre my ſelfe to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Powel</hi> his ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what I ſhall ſay, whoſe wiſdome and integriti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I know very well, will readily give teſtimony with me in this matter. I had occaſion to goe to the river banke, to gather a burden of rods: And having gathered thoſe roddes, and bound them up, I ſtood on the banke of the river, and held my hat before my face, while I made a ſhort prayer unto GOD. As I ſtood thus pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my face covered, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Powel</hi> and his wife, and man-ſervant rode by on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the river. And he ſeeing and knowing mee very well, called unto me and ſaid, <hi>Enoch,</hi> what art thou doing? art thou praying? I hearing his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18509:64"/>voice, pluckt my hat from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my face, and ſaid unto him, I hope M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Powel</hi> it is no offence to make a little prayer to GOD. Hee anſwered mee againe, No, no <hi>Enoch,</hi> no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at all, and there with hee rode away laughing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This is all I doe aſſure you Sir, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Powel</hi> ſaw in me both for the place, and for the matter. And with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of <hi>Enoch,</hi> I ſatisfied a grave and prudent knight, Sir <hi>Andrew Corbet,</hi> and divers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlemen, who by the generality of the fame, though moſt falſe, had given credence thereunto. And this, and the reſt of his anſwers to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inventions, ſerve to cleare <hi>Enoch</hi> from ſuſpition of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and do ſettle the bloudie

A better concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore naturally flowing from the words of the Apoſtle, becauſe expreſly contained in the words, is this: <hi>As Cain murdring of his brother was from the inſtinct of the Divell in his wicked heart, onely becauſe the</hi> LORD <hi>approved his ſacrifice: So the murthering of Iohn ap E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van by Enoch his elder brother proceeded from the ſame ſatanical inſtinct, and impreſsion of rage in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to his wicked heart, only becauſe he kneeled at the ſacred Communion.</hi> And this is all that politike ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="27">27 My ſecond Argument is this: <hi>Enoch ap Evan</hi> ſlayes his brother, either for this cauſe onely, that <hi>Iohn</hi> would kneele at the Communion, or for ſome other cauſe.

He was an high-minded fellow in ſpirituall matters, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18509:71"/>whatſoever advice I gave him from time to time (for I was eighteene times with him) preſſing him to Humiliation, Repentance, Faith, Teares, Prayer, Confeſſion, and the like ſpirituall Actions: Hee ſeemed very thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from mee, and in token of his gratitude, hee ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed to kiſſe my hand, and told mee, upon all viſitations of him, that he ſpent his whole time in the exerciſe of theſe gratious vertues. But they who lived in the houſe with him, and diligently noted the whole tenour of his life and actions after his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could not diſcover any Symptomes or conſequents of the practice of theſe pretended vertues: for neither was his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18509:72"/>countenance dejected, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion impaired, or his meales in quantity abated: He fed as plentifully, dranke as liberally, diſcourſed as freely, as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did, who dieted at the ſame table with him, payed the ſame rates of weekely charge, though there detained, not as malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, but priſoners for debt. He was frequent and much in poring on the Bible, and ſtill he told me, that he uſed the helpe of reading, to quicken his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meditations, and to ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his practice of repentance, of faith, and prayer. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d unto him, that folitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and retired privacie, voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all other imployments, were the beſt meanes of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning devotion, by putting his ſoule into <hi>Soliloquie</hi> with GOD.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18509:72"/>Reading, I told him, for a man in his caſe, was not ſo proper, and fit for his ſoule, as ſpirituall ejaculations of his heart unto GOD in fervent devotion, of ſighes, of prayers, of confeſſion. For his reading not only ſtirred up in him many By-thoughts, begetting queſtions imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to his preſent condition and ſtate; but alſo made him incline unto, and arrogate too much to his owne private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the deſperate ſupplanters of his miſerable ſoule. The beſt courſe I affirmed for a man in his caſe to take, was to renounce his owne judgement, will, and affections, which had alreadie enthralled him to Satan, and to apply himſelfe to the duties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him by GOD's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: and for queſtions emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18509:73"/>which might concerne him, to take directions therein from them, whoſe knowledge was more ripe, judgements more exact, as confirmed by experience of GOD's love and favour, and their hearts better compoſed to piety, charity, and unity, than his owne wilde and perturbed affections were. Yet notwithſtanding all my love, and care, and paines taken to do him good, he would ſtil run his owne courſes, and follow the wayes of his owne heart: By which he lay ſtil expoſed to the cunning ſtratagems of Satan, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> politike ſupplanter. For in the arrogant pride of his over war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpirit, he judged his owne ignorant and ungoverned heart as well able by learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious counſell to preſcribe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18509:73"/>unto himſelfe, as all the grave, pious, and learned Miniſters in this Land could have done: ſuch was the force of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deluſions, wherewith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had blinded, and detained him captive.</p>
            <p n="29">29 He was never obſerved in more than ſix weekes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, to ſhed one teare in teſtimonie of ſorrow for his crying ſinnes, or to note the preſence of GOD's Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him: No, not although two of his ſiſters joyning in prayer with mee upon their knees, plentifully powred them forth in his behalfe. Indeed, I doe freely and ingenuouſly make knowne to the World, that his complexion was not apt for teares: but the preſent diſtreſſe of his ſoule under
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18509:74"/>the fearefull expectation of GOD's confounding wrath juſtly provoked, might either have terrified, or mollified him to ſome ſignes of humiliation and ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="30">30 When hee was brought before the Reverend and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Iudges, no conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoule appeared in him, either from the ſenſe of his owne wickedneſſe, or from the <hi>Gravitie</hi> of their <hi>Perſons,</hi> juſtly made terrible to malefactours by the weight of their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: But where grace ſanctifies not to the Intenerating of the heart, there pride will puffe up and be diſplayed in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For as the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port<note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam. 15.32.</note> of <hi>Agag,</hi> King of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites,</hi> that being a captive priſoner, and called to appeare

This I obſerved, diſliked, and to his face in the preſence of many perſons, reproved in him, and told him that a face more horrid and over-growne with haire, better beſeemed the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his facts. The evidence of his murders, ſo often pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the world, by his free and voluntary confeſſion, might
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18509:75"/>have prevented the formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Law, by <hi>Iury, conviction</hi> and <hi>caſting,</hi> and have put him into the power of the Iudge for Sentence of death from his own acknowledgement, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his guilt: But for more ſtrength of juſtice and regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of proceeding, the <hi>Iury,</hi> as I heard, found him guilty, and made him liable to Sentence of death: which Sentence, after it was pronounced againſt him, the place where, and the manner of his execution for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents thereof, by hanging in a frame of iron, being not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto him: he was no more altered in his countenance, or changed in his behaviour, than if no terrible voice of death had beene uttered unto him. On Saturday the ſeventeenth of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18509:75"/>
               <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1633, after he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to death, I came to him in the afternone, partly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his behaviour and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the horror of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed on him; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by counſel accommodate to his preſent condition, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for a penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tial diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And having ſhut up my ſelf and him into a private roome, and by directions and prayer to GOD for him, prepared him for death in the beſt manner I was able; I deſired him with preſſing perſwaſions to reveale unto me the perſon, or perſons by whoſe politike ſeducements hee was drawne to thoſe opinions, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and raging in their furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cruelty. For at the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this I had long aimed, but could never with arguments or
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18509:76"/>entreaties obtaine at his hands. And I am of opinion from his reſolution of contumacie in the concealement hereof, that for the ſecurity of that party by whom he was inveigled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived therein, he had either by ſecret compact, or by an act of his owne deſperate will, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on himſelfe an oath of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie: for he anſwered me that day, as hee had often done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and continued in that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie to his death, that not from man, but from GOD he had received thoſe conceits; which I knew to be as falſe, as I know it to be true that mine owne ſoule is living within me. For how could it poſſibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that an unlearned Ruſticke ſhall fall ſo directly upon the Controverſies of our Church
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18509:76"/>in Diſcipline and Ceremonies, without a ſchiſmatical guide to informe and perſwade him, and thereby to ruine and undo him. And to the ſoule of that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Lay perſon I ſpeak, who is yet living, and conſcious to himſelfe, that by his perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or directions, this man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſeduced in opinion, and thereby inſnared by Satan thus to ſcandalize the Church of GOD, and hazard the ſtate of his own ſoule for ever: let him repent of his wickedneſſe, and reforme his owne judgement therein: leſt the juſtice of GOD for his cloſe hypocrifie, leave him under the raigne of his own carnall will utterly devoid of His gracious Spirit. For it is no new or unknowne thing in this Kingdome, for Miniſters of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18509:77"/>that ſtampe to lay violent hands upon their owne perſons, and in the agony of their ſoules, by torment of wounded conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to fore-doe themſelves. For not above two yeares ago, both in the Imperial City of <hi>London,</hi> and in other parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, divers of that ſect have ſhortned their owne dayes, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the vexation of confounded ſpirits: which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies that old prover be, <hi>Omne quod rutilat non est aurum:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that glitters is not gold.</p>
            <p n="31">31 For it is well knowne in this County of ours, that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of that ſect, neglecting the duties of ſo ſacred a calling, and for his opinions ſake, applying himſelfe to a ſecular vocation in teaching a Grammar ſchoole;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18509:77"/>did in the day time, as he walkt in the ſchoole in a paſſion of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſtemper in his heart, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himſelfe of his Virility:</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereby the workes of GOD and Nature: and <hi>Origen</hi>-like caſtrated himſelfe, though not for the kingdom of heaven. Which ſhewes that <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit is not alwayes preſent in thoſe mens hearts to guide them, who violate their loyalty to their Prince, by renting the unity of the Churches peace. This man being two years before this fact of his, convented before a grave and learned Official in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of <hi>Hereford</hi> for his <hi>Non</hi>-conformity: the reverend Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, as he told me himſelfe, offred him all the courteſie and kindneſſe that might be; hoping by moderation of proceeding,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18509:78"/>and wiſe perſwaſions, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his errours, reforme his judgement, rectifie his irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, and winne him to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But the frowardneſſe of this man, faſt bound to his owne fancies, neglected and ſleighted the Gentlemans kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So that after much par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and many paſſages, and croſſe bouts of oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them; the learned and prudent Gentleman finding him rather obſtinate in his will, by being ſtrongly conceited of his owne opinions, than judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly grounded with weight of arguments to ſupport his vaine cauſe, asked him this plaine and familiar queſtion; <hi>What if your Governours ſhould require you to ſit or ſtand in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Communion, would
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18509:78"/>you then doe?</hi> He replyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily, <hi>Then would I kneele.</hi> Which anſwer plainly imports that not tenderneſſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as many pretend; but pride and ſtubborneſſe of will in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing ſubjection to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, is the true and the onely cauſe of their diſobedience to the Majeſty of our King, the annointed of the LORD, and to the equitie of his lawes; and is alſo that pernicious foment and oyle of ſelfe-will, which nouriſheth the flame of <hi>Schiſme and faction,</hi> and maintaineth the breach of our peace and unity of heart.</p>
            <p n="32">32 There was alſo a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Tewxbury,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who was a ſtrict, auſtere, and rigid <hi>Puritane,</hi> of a Mechanical vocation: and this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18509:79"/>man being choſen fourteene years before his death Church-warden of his Pariſh, did then in his firſt time of office, take downe a croſſe of ſtone, built in the Church-yard of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; and which had continued there, time out of minde. And this he did of a proud contempt of all ancient Monuments of that nature. The ſtones of the ſaid croſſe hee placed looſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Church-wall, where they continued by the ſpace of fourteene yeares free from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or rapine: for it ſeemes the people of the Neighbourhood made conſcience of ſacriledge. It pleaſed GOD, that the two next children which his wife brought into the world, proved deaſe, lame, and deformed by monſtroſity of body: as by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18509:79"/>good report I have beene told, and ſo continue to this very day. The father of theſe children never once ſuſpecting that the hand of Divine correction was laid upon his family, for his own diſobedience to his Prince and Governours, or for his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and defacing of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Monuments of other mens devotion, perſiſts ſtil in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinions of ſchiſmaticall diſobedience, without any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or reformation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For it may be he had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelfe obſerved, or by relation from others had heard it confirmed, that the children of other men had miſcarried in their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, their ſenſes and bodily ſhapes, and were expoſed to the world for <hi>Ludibria Naturae,</hi> as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18509:80"/>well as his. And attributing theſe things to ſecondary can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and errours in naturall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations frequent in the world, he never look't up to the hard of Heaven; but ſtill pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his irregular courſes. And being fourteene yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his firſt election, choſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine Church-warden of the ſame Pariſh, he tooke the ſtones of the former defaced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed croſſe, which lay look under the Church-wall, and by cementing them together, and hewing a hollow gutter in them, converts them to a ſwine trough for his owne uſe.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18509:81"/>of a maid, whom he had devir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated and defloured; ſaid to the reſt of his fellowes in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi>'s preſence, I could finde in my heart to breake yonder knaves pate, but that it is a ſin, and I have enough of that upon me already: To whom <hi>Enoch</hi> replied, It is no finne <hi>to kill death, and had I knowne that knave to bee the Hang-man, I would have beaten out his braines, if I could have come at him.</hi> Theſe words of his, begate over all the Priſon-houſe (conſiſting of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) great exclamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Enoch</hi> his wickedneſſe, being himſelfe a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſon, and ſhould have imployed his thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better matters. The next day in the morning, as ſoone
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18509:82"/>as I was come to the priſon-houſe to ſee this condemned malefactour, and to know how hee ſtood prepared for death: Three perſons ſeverally one from another, gave me notice of <hi>Enoch</hi> his words uttered the day before in the hearing of many<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hee replied unto mee, I ſpake indeed thoſe words in jeſt. In jeſt, quoth I unto him?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18509:82"/>are you, being a condemned perſon by judiciall ſentence, a fit perſon to utter jeſts? do you not know that no Kingdome of the world can poſſibly ſubſiſt in Iuſtice and Honour, without the ſervice of ſuch perſons as ſhal be aſſigned to execute thoſe lawes upon the perſons of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours; if Law condemne by juſt and upright ſentence, the wicked facts and perſons of ſuch men, as by violating equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, diſturbe the peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Kingdomes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; are thoſe Lawes of any force without the miniſtry and ſervice of ſuch men, as ſhall put them in execution? Surely, <hi>Enoch,</hi> the eye of your heart and judgement, is not yet open to ſee your abominable villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which doe yet rage and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18509:83"/>ſwell within you: nor is your minde, with the illumination whereof you have ſo much in ſecret pleaſed your ſelfe, guided by GOD's Spirit. For had theſe gifts of GOD taken place in your ſoule, as you have ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the perſon of the Hang-man would have beene rather pleaſing than offenſive unto you, as being the inſtrument of GOD's mercy, to let out your ſoule ſurcharged by gripes of your conſcience with fearefull tremblings, into the glorious preſence and welcome imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of CHRIST your SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18509:83"/>you. If you die in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and unchriſtian moods, it is more than greatly to bee feared, for it is evident and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that your owne perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall election, whereof you have ſo much talked, was but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous errour, and a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe opinion, by Satanicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
            <p n="34">34 Now touching this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and his opinions, hee was charged to hold ſome points of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſtes:</hi> matters I dare be bold to ſay, becauſe I know it right well, farre beyond the reach of his apprehenſion, for excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his diſtlike of our Church-ceremonies, and his proud opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his owne ſpirituall eſtate in the favour of GOD, he was a moſt ignorant m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18509:84"/>of knowledge belonging to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The matters of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherewith hee was ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, were principally theſe: Firſt, that the ſoule of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, is perfectly pure and cleane within him, by vertue of his New-birth, and conſents not, either in the underſtanding by approbation, or in the will by election and inclination to any act of ſin: But that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the body and fleſh, which remaining unſanctified and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally defiled, ſollicites, urges, provokes unto all evill, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth all acts thereof in the elect of GOD, after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and regeneration. This opinion is a monſter in nature, not onely divorcing the ſoule and body each from other it the time of this life: but alſo
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18509:84"/>attributing unto the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all motion, influence, or concomitancie of the ſoule, the producing of actions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations reall and ſinfull. This <hi>Enoch,</hi> though of meane appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in philoſophicall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, underſtood right well; and his opinion herein, was onely this and no more: That for as much as ſanctification, which is very rightly and aptly tearmed <hi>Inherent Righteouſneſſe,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the decayes of originall grace in our ſoules, and re-indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Image of GOD into us, is not perfect in this life: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all reall acts of ſindone by a childe of GOD in ſtate of grace, there is a conſent to that act, both in the underſtanding and the will, the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oble and principal faculties of our ſoules;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18509:85"/>for without aſſent of theſe, no act is ever produced; but it is ſuch a conſent, as carries not with full ſway and violence, either of theſe powers within us, pleaſingly with ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and approbation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thoſe actions: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by infirmity under the ſtrength of temptation, they themſelves are ſeduced to aſſent and execute things evill, and are thereby for the preſent ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And of this his opinion he was deſirous to make illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his owne perſon: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that his regenerate ſoule, in the very time and act of theſe murders, ſtirred up ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancie within him, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended his fulneſſe of conſent in the perpetration thereof. His opinion I allow as a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or illuſtration thereof in his owne perſon, it is <hi>Heterodox,</hi> unſound, and of all good men to bee abhorred. For an act of wrath, reſolving it ſelfe into malice, contrived in the minde for the execution, and terminated in bloud and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cannot poſſibly be admitted to participate of infirmity. His <hi>Second opinion</hi> charged upon him, was this. That CHRIST our LORD, is not now in heaven in that body, which by ſanctified conception and incarnation Hee tooke of the ſubſtance of the holy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin; and in which Hee converſed among the Iewes. His anſwer to this was,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18509:86"/>that he was miſtaken by certain perſons, as unlearned as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who buſily and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed queſtions unto him, and were not able rightly to conceive his anſwers, nor the nature of their owne queſtions propoſed unto him: For both he, and they wanting the true apprehenſion of ſo high and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Myſtery, as is the Nature and Quality of our LORD IESUS CHRIST His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Body, tooke libertie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves to talke at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of high and myſterious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and thereby loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their vaine janglings. His faith and judgement was very right in this point, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſmall meaſure of his underſtanding: But he wanted apt termes to explicate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18509:86"/>in ſo deepe a matter. When therfore I acquainted him with ſome termes frequent in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Schoole-men, in the enodation of an Article of our Faith ſo abſtruſe and difficult, and tranſcending the ſphere of vulgar apprehenſions: telling him, that the Body of our <hi>Lord</hi> was paſſive, mortall, liable to violence in the ſtate of His <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation:</hi> Impaſſive, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, glorious, and exempt from infirmities and injuries in the condition of his exaltation; he freely aſſented, ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and confirmed that to be his meaning, that our LORD His bleſſed and glorious Body, was changed onely in qualitie, not in ſubſtance: But that for want of Theologicall termes, he was not able to unfold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18509:87"/>And then the Concluſion touching his opinions, is this, he was neither Anabaptiſt, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt, or of any other odde ſect whatſoever, but only a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Ignorant, and downe-right Engliſh Puritane.</p>
            <p n="35">35 On Tueſday the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> this Malefactour, the ſtaine of Nature, and reproch of mankind, was carried on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back from <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> thirteene miles to the place of his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When hee was come to <hi>Biſhops-caſtle</hi> Towne, hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Inne to receive the holy Communion of the moſt ſacred Body and Bloud of our LORD IESUS CHRIST; which I had refuſed to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto him, becauſe he would not take it in the decent and Reverent geſture of kneeling.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18509:87"/>The Miniſter of that Towne, a learned Gentleman, refuſed likewiſe to give it unto him, unleſſe hee would receive it in obedience to his Superiours, and kneele downe Reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that holy Action. A while hee continued obſtinate, but overcome at laſt by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, hee yeelded as hee ſaid, to gratifie the deſires of a Gentleman there preſent. Thus the man, who in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious zeale of an inraged heart, drew that bloud, that bred and nouriſhed him, comming to the point of his death, ſhrunke in his courage, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his contumacie; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pleaſe men, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure favour in the mitigation of execution of Iudgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, fell from the ground
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18509:88"/>of his unhallowed profeſſion. Which convincingly proveth that obſtinate Hypocriſie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing diſloyalty in contempt of Authority, is built upon a weake, a ſlippery, an unſtable foundation.</p>
            <p n="36">36 This Malefactor, being now come to the place, where the Gibbet was erected for his exemplary puniſhment: Hee kneeled downe and made a ſhort prayer to GOD.

When hee had hanged forth waving in the ayre, more then a fortnight, and leſſe then three weekes, ſome Brethren of his owne diſpoſition and faction, who are reſtleſſe in wilfulneſſe (that I may not ſay wickednes) contrived a device by rearing up a ladder in the night, a worke of darkneſſe, to ſaw off that part of the Gibbet where his body hanged, and tooke it away even then, when the ſmell and ſtench thereof was ſo unſavory and noyſome, as hardly able to bee indured; unleſſe they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with ſtronge <hi>Antidotes</hi> to correct the loathſome ſavour of his putrified carkaſſe: but it was a meſſe good enough for ſuch

            <p n="43">43 I publikely told them five Moneths agoe, namely in Iuly laſt paſt 1633 in a Preface to my Catechiſme Lecture in a very great aſſembly; that it was to bee feared that they who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not the Lawes of the King, did curſe his ſacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in their hearts, contrary to that rule.<note place="margin">Eccle. 10.20.</note>

               </gap>, to which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18509:101"/>hee refuſeth to yeeld true and faithfull ſubjection. Now this inward curſe lighting on the law which is diſobeyed, reflects or rather falls directly on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie of the King, from whoſe ſacred Authority as hee is the immediate Vicegerent of God, that law receives either <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or Ratification and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for obedience.</hi> This ſenſe I obtrude not on theſe Perſons, as arrogating to my ſelfe infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of judgement in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Spirit; But I refer it to the grave and deliberat judgement of thoſe prudent and learned Perſons, who fit at the Helme of government in our Church, and are more profound in knowledge, and fully able to reſolve and cleere this doubt; for as then, ſo now I deliver onely
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18509:102"/>my opinion and no more. But yet let me further tell them, that ſince they like not to bee told that their thoughts and hearts do <hi>Curſe Chriſtian Kings</hi> whoſe lawes check and countermaund their novell fancies: what will they ſay to that place of ſacred Scriptures<note n="z" place="margin">Iob 34.18.</note> 
               <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King thou art wicked,</hi> &amp;c. If the lawes, whoſe rigour, life, and authority, flow immediately from Kings and Princes in their Dominions, bee in their Nature wicked as they are Lawes, certainely the Princes themſelves who enact or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize thoſe lawes, in the cenſure and judgement of thoſe men who vilifie the ſame lawes by refuſing to obey them, cannot be good. So that let them turne themſelves which way they will, they are taken in a ſnare
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18509:102"/>woven from the cleare ſenſe of the ſacred Scripture. For either they curſe the King in his lawes, or they judge not his Perſon to be righteous from whom unjuſt and unrighteous lawes doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, and are impoſed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. For they cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affirme the King to bee righteous, nor his lawes to bee righteous, when they refuſe to give obedience both to the one and to the other. I know they will reply, that they love and honour the King, but that they like not his lawes. And I anſwere them againe, it is impoſſible to love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King, and to diſlike his lawes: for the lawes are the Spirit and life of the King as he is Supreame head over his people, ſecuring the royalty of his Princely State, and ſweetly attracting his ſubjects to cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18509:103"/>obedience. For therefore doe the ſubjects honour, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and love the perſon of the King, becauſe of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and equity of his laws, whereby they are governed in tranquillity and peace. And on the contrary, no man living in the world, doth naturally, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſweetly love the perſon of a Tyrant, becauſe he rules by the rage of his affections, and the ſtrong hand of power; and not by the peaceable rule of Iuſtice, and approved lawes. So that the true and cordiall love of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their King, ariſeth in them, not onely from relation of ſuperiority in his perſon, and inferiority in theirs; but much more fervently and firmely from his pious care in conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting good lawes for the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18509:103"/>of his people in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wealth, peace and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, free from the vaſſallage of oppreſſing ſubjection.</p>

And if all the policy of this wiſe, learned and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kingdome, ſhall wracke and teynter it ſelfe, totally to ſuppreſſe and ſupplant theſe courſes; it will never be able, in my poore opinion, to effect their juſt &amp; righteous deſignes, till a proportionable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſetting Miniſters free from a ſervile dependance and ingagement to their people, do ſweetly invite and induce them to obedience.

            <p>It is a great indignitie that poore and laborious countrey Farmers, doe pay their Tythes to the Miniſters of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But that Merchants flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Thus farre the Law

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18509:133"/>(and I truſt all good men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with me therein:) That as the Lord in mercy and holy love unto his Church among us, hath given <hi>Pure Wiſedome</hi> to his Anointed Vice-gerent, to diſcover theſe obliquities and Impoſtures; and alſo Royall courage to attempt the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſuppreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: So, he will alſo ſtrengthen and uphold his Princely Arme in his proceedings therein, till he have brought the ſame to a gratious and to a glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And then will this Church and Kingdome know, both in the generall body ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and alſo more ſpecially in theſe <hi>Non-conformists</hi> the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, both Eccleſiaſticall and Secular, when their eyes are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to behold their owne
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18509:133"/>errours; That they have beene long deteyned, and deluded in adoring vaine fantaſies, not worth the regarding. And then they will alſo bleſſe and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the LORD'S great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and returne the Tribute of thankfull and of loyal hearts to their gratious Sovereigne, by whoſe pious care ſo lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and glorious a work hath beene proſpered and atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For, though now, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in their ſoules, do dimme, darken, and even blinde the eye of their Iudgements, and not ſuffer them with the cleere light of ſanctified Reaſon to behold this wholeſome and profitable truth ſhine forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Namely, That <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> betweene the Prince and his People, and

And if theſe men will but entertaine that one rule of our LORD and SAVIOUR IESUS CHRIST:<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note>

            <p>The whole force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſo clear and concluſive, is drawne from the practice of GOD Himſelfe in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive infancie of the Chriſtian Church: when the <hi>Roman Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> mighty in power and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of authority over moſt parts of the habitable earth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the glory of our LORD IESUS CHRIST in the luſtre of His Goſpell, and vowed the extinction of His Name and memory: but the more their fury increaſed and inſulted over the poore ſheepe of CHRIST, daily dragged

If any ſhal reply unto mee, that Humane power may for a time ſuppreſſe the outward growth and ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this diſobedience to our King and his Lawes: yet for as much as they are godly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, and doe it for conſcience ſake, their practice will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpirituall heat and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous warmth in the root and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret heart thereof; and thereby ſprout out againe, and declare
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18509:140"/>it ſelfe to bee of the LORD'S plantation. To theſe men I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply no more but thus; That I wiſh all ſuch perſons to ſuſpend their owne raſh and ſiniſter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions for a time, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the event of the LORD'S will therein, which in doubtfull caſes, is never knowne but by the ſenſible and apparent mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation thereof.</p>
            <p n="51">51 Now for this firy fancie, and exquiſite faſcination of our <hi>Non</hi>-conformity, I will freely and openly deliver my opinion thereof, and that is this: <hi>That when ſhe was in her greateſt ruffe and glory,</hi> deckt with all the plumes of her pride and beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation which ever ſhe had in this Kingdome: I conceive of her, that then, even then ſhe was no more but <hi>meretrix ceruſſata,</hi> a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18509:140"/>whited, painted, and artificially coloured ſtrumpet, expoſing her ſelfe to her moſt profitable wooers, and entertainers: But now that by time and age, ſhee is become <hi>Rugoſa &amp; cadavero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> wrinckled and decayed, ſhee goes on, I hope, to her grave with infamie and diſhonour. The reaſon of my opinion is this; I ſuppoſe that if her ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt champions, who have long with the ſecret increaſe of their private eſtates ſupported her glory, could now come off fairely from her, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to their livelihood and eclipſe of the brightneſſe of their former reputation for Piety and Sincerity: That then not one of them, would either depart this Land, or endure to bee ſilenced and reſtrained
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:18509:141"/>from preaching: but being ſhut up in a ſtrait, by reflecting on their owne hearts, and calling to minde, what high and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent prayſes they have in corners given to this their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the engine and inſtrument of all their deluſions, and the artificial and fine-wrought key, whereby they have opened the Cloſets and Cabinets of their deare and privat friends: if now they ſhould ſhrinke from it, they overthrow for ever the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their integrity. And therefore having within their owne boſomes, a troubleſome conflict betweene their hearts, puffed up with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their late glory and deare eſteeme among their friends; and their conſciences now ſecretly prompting them,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:18509:141"/>that the grounds of their Schiſme, were things light, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall, and of no moment: The pride of their hearts, beares downe with ſtrong power, the plea of their conſciences, and makes them reſolve rather to endure a ſilencing, with hope to retaine the under-hand bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volences of their tender hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted friends, than to ſupplant the pleaſing contentments they have received to themſelves, in appropriating to themſelves the words of GOD's Spirit,<note place="margin">Prov. 12.26.</note>

And this is the true cauſe why I was ſo bold and plaine with them, as to tearme their practice of <hi>Non</hi>-conformity, by the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of a <hi>Painted Strumpet:</hi> becauſe a learned Philoſopher deſcribing the Arts and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of ſuch wanton and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane perſons, ſayes of them; <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18509:143"/>therunto; for if once this bright ray and beame of divine truth glance into their ſoules, and be received by them with pauſe, deliberation, and more prudent inſpection into their former courſes, than formerly they have uſed; then theſe men know right wel <hi>Actum eſt de illis,</hi> their Acts are diſcovered, and their Play is exploded. For now ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing from the execution of ſo ſacred a vocation, is become in this age for temporall emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments, farre more profitable to this kinde of men, than the godly labours of religious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the conſtant imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their talents proves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: So miſerably are <hi>Gods</hi> people led blindfolded into ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall captivity. But if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes of theſe men were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18509:144"/>and the cloſe-wrought veyle wherein all their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are enwrapped, were Tranſlucent, and thereby their ſleights expoſed to the view of all men, I make no queſtion but that the leproſie of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption would bee ſenſibly diſcovered to have maculated their hearts and conſciences. For it is not poſſible that <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> ſhould erre in deſcribing the Acts and Qualities of ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, marke them which cauſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among you, and offences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrine that yee have learned, and avoyd them: for they that are ſuch ſerve not the</hi> LORD IESUS, <hi>but their owne belly, and by good words and faire ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> And theſe men in

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:18509:145"/>now much to diſtaſte them, and greatly deſire the ſuppreſſion of them: But which is more, even their owne friends alſo, who were wholly theirs, begin to faint in their courage, and in ſome degrees to diſtaſte thoſe courſes, if they could hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely ſhake them off, and yet preſerve the reputation of their former zeale. For this is the maine blocke, which moſt of them ſtumble at; namely, Not feare of diſhonouring GOD, nor hurting the purity of their owne conſciences, if they ſhould ſhake hands, and bid farewell to their niceties and follies: But how to keepe up their credits in the hearts of thoſe men, who being honeſt, vertuous, and worthy of good reſpect, they have much vilified &amp; diſ-eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18509:145"/>in matters of religion, in compariſon with themſelves. But this is a needleſſe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous care; for I am of opinion that all honeſt hearted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, both Miniſters and Lay-people, who zealouſly deſire the peace and flouriſh of our Church and Kingdome, will readily give them the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of unfained fellowſhip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into their boſomes with alacrity and joy for their return to the obedience of their ſpirituall Mother the Church, and never twit, nor upbraid them with their former toyiſh errours. And here let me put you my Brethren of <hi>Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in minde, which you ought to take in good part, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at my hands, from the ſenſe and experience thereof in

            <p n="52">52 And here I am forced much againſt my will, to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for mine owne integrity and innocencie in a particular matter, which lately fell out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, in which I have beene by many of this factious Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hood moſt impudently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed. The matter would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long to relate it with all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances incident thereunto:
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18509:148"/>take it therefore thus, with al the brevity I am able. The moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father in <hi>God,</hi> the L. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of our Dioceſſe, preached a Sermon in our Towne upon Sunday the 8. day of <hi>Sept.</hi> laſt paſt, two dayes before his Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He tooke for his <hi>Theme</hi> or Text the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Feare</hi> GOD, <hi>and honour the King.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> This portion of Scripture he made choiſe of, as being moſt fit and apt for the place where it was delivered: becauſe of the proneneſſe of many of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to diſloyalty, by factious ſchiſme, and diſobedience to our Churches Lawes. Vpon this Text he diſcourſed with ſoundneſſe of learning, gravity of ſpeech, and gratious charity, endeavouring rather to win our people, by mildneſſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18509:148"/>love, than by force of his owne Authority, and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of coercive power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them to obedience, by caſting off their ſingularity of opinions, and irregular follies. Vpon the next Friday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a country Miniſter ſixteene miles from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> who had appeared on Tueſday at the Viſitation, and was detained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his friends, as hee calls them, was requeſted to beſtow a Sermon among them. This man being wholly ignorant of the L. Biſhops Text, whereon he had diſcourſed the Sunday before; choſe for his ſubject, the words of our <hi>Lord, Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>feare not them which kill the body,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words bearing no contrariety with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops <hi>Theame,</hi> becauſe GOD's
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18509:149"/>ſacred Word hath no repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie, or contradiction in it; He handled with ſuch boldneſſe of courage, freedome of ſpeech, and preſſing perſwaſions to conſtancie in the faith; as if the ſuppreſſing of <hi>Non</hi>-conformity now gratiouſly intended by the Royall wiſdome of our King, and the zealous endevours of our Superiour Clergie, could not take effect in this Illuſtrious Church, without derogation to the glory of our LORD and SAVIOUR, and the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the free paſſage of our bleſſed Goſpell. This Sermon was generally diſliked, rather for the manner of uttering it, than for any erroneous doctrine therein delivered: for excepting onely the light brotherhood of <hi>Non</hi>-conformity, and their fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:18509:149"/>and abettors, who applaud every thing concurrent with their fancies and humours: All the wiſer ſort of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who heard their Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Sermon on Sunday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, judged him a very bold ſpirited man, in labouring to poſſeſſe the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſecretly, with a fear of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry returning upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The rumour of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being quicke in all mens mouths, and the ſubject of moſt mens diſcourſe, came to me by report of perſons wiſe, learned, and credible. Among many who diſliked it, a learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, a Miniſter of GOD's Word, and Fellow of Queenes Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> told me it was <hi>A moſt factious Sermon,</hi> mainely oppoſing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:18509:150"/>of our Church, and ſuch as deſerved to be ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured: Which cenſure, our moſt Reverend Dioceſan ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wiſdome and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath already inflicted. Vpon the Sunday following, being the fifteenth day of the ſame moneth, after the reading of the ſecond Leſſon, I read forth of a paper certaine <hi>Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> given mee in charge to be publiſhed, concerning the Adorning of our Church in ſundry particulars, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties expreſſe command touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preachers: When I came to that Article concerning the duties of Miniſters, I told that great Congregation that I had beene credibly informed that a very <hi>factious Sermon</hi> had beene
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18509:150"/>preached on Friday before in the hearing of them: And I told them alſo; that theſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which many of them foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their boſomes with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing contentment, would ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to be better looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the connivence which they had formerly long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, would by more care of prudent vigilancy, be forthwith corrected. Vpon theſe words of mine, ſome falſe-hearted fellow of that proud and lying genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſends word by writing, or meſſage to this Preacher, into the country, that Mr. <hi>Studley</hi> had charged him with preaching falſe doctrine. The Miniſter being netled with this report, with all haſt repaires to our Towne: where he and many of his ſchiſmatical friends &amp; good
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18509:151"/>
               <hi>Benefactours,</hi> draw forth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate in writing, ſubſcribed with many hands, in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a moſt lewd and falſe report: and hee being ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Brachio carnali,</hi> omits the duty of a man trucly fearing GOD: for in all haſte he poſtes to the Lord Biſhop, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd his clamorous writing, but never vouchſafed to confer with me, who could have reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him the truth, pacified his rage, and prevented an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience which afterwards fell upon him. And here I muſt for the clearing of mine own name, traduced for a perſecutour in oppoſing the cauſe of <hi>Non</hi>-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, infert a letter of a ſharp contents written by mee to the ſaid Preacher, expoſtulating with him the injuſtice and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18509:151"/>wrongs I have received from him.</p>
            <p n="53">53 M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>F.</hi> my love remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred unto you, as unknowne unto me: I underſtand that you have preferred a Petition or Certificate to the moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father in GOD the Lord Biſhop of our Dioceſſe, againſt me: wherein aſſuredly the fury of your will over-ran the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of your wit. In that your inconſiderate Petition, you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me moſt falſly, to have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced you for preaching falſe doctrine to our people. But by ſuch intemperate boldneſſe of writing, you have ſhewed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſdome, nor honeſty, nor charity. Not wiſdome, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on truſt, without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a report ſo weighty: Not honeſty, in your contempt of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:18509:152"/>my perſon, whom you ought of duty to have privately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, not charity, which is never ſuſpitious of evill, before it be convinced by evidence of fact. But he that expects from Sectaries and Schiſmatikes, any of theſe vertues, will fall ſhort of his expectation. For your oppoſing of mee, and my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, know you Sir, I regard not ſuch light-headed and furious companions. I have made your betters deſiſt from contending with me, and may hap ſo to doe with you, if you perſiſt in your folly. My integrity in my place, I praiſe GOD for it, was well knowne many yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your heady and raſh youth by <hi>Non</hi>-conformity and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries crept in among us. But you, and ſuch as you are, have by
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18509:152"/>your Phariſaicall and ſly infinuations into the hearts of ignorant and unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed people, rent in pieces the unity of a famous Towne, and expoſed our people to faction and diſſention. The words I uttered againſt your Sermon, not your perſon (for I named you not) were theſe, and only theſe, <hi>I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that you had preached a very factious Sermon;</hi> And hee, who gave other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my words, was an egregious <hi>Knave;</hi> ſo tell him from me, you have it under my hand: For both your Text, and the clamorous vehemencie of your iterations and repetitions confirme this report. Your behaviour therein was very ſly and cunning, and full of reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſſe; yet not ſo covered with Art and ſubtilty, but that your more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Auditours diſcovered, that the aime and levell of your intentions, was to inſinuate into the hearts of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a perplexing feare that the wilde
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:18509:153"/>
               <hi>Boare of Rome</hi> was ready to make a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Incurſion into our Church and State; and by her Idolatries and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions eradicate the ſacred purity of our Goſpel implanted among us. Hence grow' your important preſſings and perſwaſions to conſtancie in the Faith, even to death by Apologie and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome: wherein ſome of your owne friends have wiſhed, that the ſalt of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and prudent moderation, had allayed your violence, and ſeaſoned your thoughts to a better conceit of that gratious Prince and Government, under which we live in peace and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall liberty. The name of <hi>Puritane,</hi> you told them, was a royall badge, and and thereby you intended to confirme depraved judgements in error and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacie againſt Authority, and that wholſome reformation, that is now ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at. Surely theſe intemperat flaſhes iſſuing from your unbridled ſpirit, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18509:153"/>uttered in ſuch a time when reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Schiſme, not change of our <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox faith</hi> is intended; doe plainely convince you in the judgement of wiſe men, to be a man of a diſloyall heart, and unquiet head. Your bold intruſion into other mens charge, being neither warranted by the Lawes of GOD or man, can receive no bleſſing from GOD. For what inducement have you to vent your wares among us, who neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your aid, nor need your help. Keep at home, I adviſe you, and labour in that place of charge where the LORD hath diſpoſed of you; that ſhall bring more comfort to your conſcience, more peace to your calling, more credit to your perſon. Your Sect is very forward in running uncalled, and thruſting your ſelves upon people unknowne unto you, and ſhould for ever reſt unknown, were it not, that as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Iude</hi> 16. <hi>You have mens perſons in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18509:154"/>becauſe of advantage.</hi> Certainly GOD's Spirit hath given a moſt cleare and exact deſcription of all ſuch wily and ſeducing ſpirits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 18. It is the worke of GOD's mercy and love unto his Church, in laying open the ſpirituall ſleights (I dare not ſay impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures) wherewith your Sect hath ſo long deluded the people, and by the wiſdome and authority of our King and State to correct and reforme them. Your oppoſition to the Authority of our Lord Biſhop was ſo peremptory and inſolent by your pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of your Superiours, as is not to be endured in a peaceable Government. For you were in place, both in the Church, when his Lordſhip gave his charge, and alſo in the Chamber at the ſigne of the red Lion in our Towne, and heard his Lordſhip make knowne to us of the Clergie his Majeſties Royal care, and his gratious intentions he had
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18509:154"/>entertained in his heart, both to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and to advance the welfare of his Miniſters: But firſt he would be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of their ready ſubjection to his juſt and royall commands. Yet within three dayes after this charge ſounded in your eares, you moſt contemptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violated his Majeſties Injunctions, and being not admitted into Saint <hi>Alk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi> Church to vent your ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conceits, you put your ſelfe into an exempt and peculiar Iuriſdiction, and there you were as ſafe, in your opinion, as policie could make you. Aſſuredly M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>F.</hi> theſe factious courſes are unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by GOD, and the iſſue and event of them, being done in publike affront to the ſacred authority and command of your Prince, the LORD's annointed; will prove dangerous, if not deſperate unto you; for the ſtrong arme of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, wil cruſh thouſands of ſuch poore wormes as wee are. I my ſelfe have
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:18509:155"/>knowne within theſe twenty yeares laſt paſt. <hi>Plus minùs,</hi> many men of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wits, great and piercing underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, prompt and eloquent in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveries, of illuſtrious note and ranke in the Common-wealth: yet by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the deſignes and commands of Royal Majeſty have ruined their eſtates and fatally ended their dayes in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and miſery. For the eminencie of Princes being by Subſtitution and Vicegerencie from GOD, the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Image of Divine Majeſty for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall regiment; is by GOD's ordinance, made ſo ſacred and inviolable, both from the intemperate rage of our tongues, and the rancour of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſeditious, and rebellious hearts: That never any man, obliged to loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, made head againſt them either open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſecretly, but the Angell of the LORD's wrath purſued him to ſhame and deſtruction. For it is decreed by
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:18509:155"/>the wiſdome of GOD, and ſhall never be reverſed, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.26. <hi>Whoſoever will not obey the Law of</hi> GOD <hi>and the King, let judgement ſpeedily bee executed upon him, whether it be unto death, or unto ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or unto confiſcation of goods, or to impriſonment.</hi> For your perſon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>F.</hi> I proteſt before GOD the ſearcher of all hearts, I wiſh no otherwiſe, than to my owne ſoule: But I onely ayme at the peace of our Towne, which will never be effected, till you, and ſuch as you be reſtrained from preaching, and enkindling faction among us. Thus I have imparted my minde unto you, and for the cenſure of both our perſons, I refer it to the wiſdome and juſtice of his Lordſhip, our moſt Reverend Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan: who I doubt not will correct your inſolencies, and keepe you in order. A copy of this Letter, I have ſent to my L. Biſhop to demonſtrate how ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I have dealt with you. GOD bleſſe

            <p n="54">54 This is that Letter <hi>Verbatìm,</hi> without addition, detraction, or muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one ſyllable, againſt which ſuch tragicall out-cries have beene raiſed, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when this generation of men, who take too much ungodly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie unto themſelves, to ſuſpect evill of their neighbours, and upon that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, to raiſe lying defamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt perſons truely religious and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, ſhall governe their tongues and hearts with more holy feare of GOD, and gratious charity towards their peaceable co-habitants: I doubt not,

And for the wrongs which they very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly Imagine to have beene done to this their Miniſter, by my <hi>Perſecuting</hi> him, as they moſt wickedly phraſe it: I referre my ſelfe to my hotteſt and ſharpeſt adverſaries (whoſe tongues fly at randon without grace, wit, or hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to reſtraine them) to examine, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and determine from this relation, whether I have beene Active in doing, or paſſive in ſuffering wrongs. And from the ſight of their owne errour, or rather malicious railing and traducing of my innocence herein; let them learne to uſe more Chriſtian moderation, in reporting of things unknowne unto them: And to practiſe thoſe gratious
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:18509:157"/>vertues of integritie of heart, and truth of ſpeech, which wil more adorne their converſation, and render them more pleaſing unto GOD and man, than all their forward profeſſion of firy zeale in erroneous devotion.
